To play, simply enter coordinates between 1 and 3 for rows and columns with a space in between.

X and O alternates automatically. There is no "AI" in this simple version.

For example...

```
---------
|       | 
|       | 
|       | 
---------
Enter the coordinates: 2 2
---------
|       | 
|   X   | 
|       | 
---------
Enter the coordinates: 1 1
---------
| O     | 
|   X   | 
|       | 
---------
```
etc.
